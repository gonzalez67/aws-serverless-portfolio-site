            I was born in Barcelona so I am Catalan but my parents came to live and work in Barcelona from Cordoba (Andalucia). So I speak English, Catalan and Spanish;  I have spent 
            spent half my life in Oxford (the one in England). I arrived in Oxford because while I was waiting for a coach in Victoria Station
            the coach to Oxford arrived earlier than the one going to Cambridge. So, just luck. I don't regret it though. Oxford is a great city to live in.
            </p>
            How do I spend my time (apart from work); family, friends, studying and books. And in that order. What am I reading now? Goliath's curse by Luke Kemp. So it is politics and history what I tend to read about.

            And now read the boring part:

          I am an Application Support Analyst and Jira Administrator with 10+
          years of experience supporting enterprise applications across the
          private sector, public sector, and education. In my last role, I
          managed an Atlassian Cloud (Jira & Confluence) environment for 900+
          users, acting as the go-to person for Jira administration, access
          management, workflow configuration, and troubleshooting. 
          
          </p>

          <p>
          These were some of the activities I performed: <br />
           <ul>
                <li>Jira administration (boards, workflows, permissions, configurations).</li>
                <li>Translating business requirements into effective Jira solutions.</li>
                <li>Delivering regular configuration changes and continuous improvements.</li>
                <li>Integrating Jira with external services (including Power BI via API).</li>
                <li>Supporting users through major platform changes, including domain migrations.</li>
              
              </ul>
          </p>
         
        <p>
         In previous roles, I specialised in application support, service delivery, and release coordination, focusing on: <br />
             <ul>
                <li>Incident and problem fixing, and change management (ITIL-aligned).</li>
                <li>Coordinating developers, testers and business stakeholders.</li>
                <li>Owning and coordinating the release processes to ensure smooth deployments. This activity included backlog grooming, and tracking progress.</li>
                <li>Creating and maintaining extensive support and knowledge documentation.</li>
                            
              </ul>
          
        </p>
         
         <p>
           What I enjoy the most is bringing people together to solve problems. I am a warm person who enjoys talking to people and I do believe that issues are resolved faster when we talk rather than relying on multiple teams’ messages. I’d rather talk, understand the problem properly, and fix it. In addition, I enjoy learning new technologies; one of the great things of working in IT is that you have to continue learning.
